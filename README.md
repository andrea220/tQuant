**TensorQuant** provaaaa

is a Python financial library designed to provide students with a practical, Python-based alternative to traditional C++ implementations. Leveraging Tensor arrays, TensorQuant supports pricing, intensive risk management computations, and algorithmic differentiation. It is particularly valuable in academic settings, such as the Quant-Finance Master courses at the [University of Siena](https://finance.unisi.it/it), where it offers students hands-on experience with financial libraries and object-oriented programming during their final year.

Many of the objects in TensorQuant draw inspiration from the renowned [QuantLib](https://www.quantlib.org) library. We extend our gratitude to the QuantLib community for their foundational contributions to financial modeling. While many design patterns have been simplified for ease of understanding, TensorQuant strikes a balance between code complexity and professional architecture.
