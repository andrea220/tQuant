**TensorQuant** is a Python financial library designed to offer practical implementations for financial operations. It leverages tensor arrays for computations in **pricing**, **risk management**, and **algorithmic differentiation**.

It is particularly useful in academic settings, such as the [Finance Master courses at the University of Siena](https://finance.unisi.it/it), where students gain hands-on experience with financial libraries and object-oriented programming.

Many of TensorQuant's components draw inspiration from the renowned [QuantLib](https://www.quantlib.org) library. Our thanks go to the QuantLib community for their contributions to financial modeling. While simplified for ease of use, TensorQuant aims to strike a balance between ease of understanding and professional architecture.
